# Kratin_Task
This Repo contains working prototype using Spring Boot and React Js intended to help elder peoples

I have designed a web based platform with intention to help Old age peoples.
So this site mainly focuses in two usecases 
1) Providing Platform to add Daily Task - Here user can Add his/her daily task according to his preference and also delete it once it is completed
2) Providing Platform to add Banks and Withdraw cash - Here user can add bank with appropriate bank details and then view balance , also if user aims to withdraw cash he can do it accordingly where he requires to enter amount to be withdrawn and the bank bank employee will deliver entered cash at his place.


Here I have attached Scrrenshots of website
